# Turing TopCoder Assessment: The Resonant Triad

## Overview
This repository contains a Problem Setting task for a Div1/Div2 competitive programming problem.
The problem "The Resonant Triad" is a constructive algorithm challenge based on number theory (Euclidean algorithm variant) disguised as a sci-fi resource management puzzle.

## Components
- **qwen/**: Evidence of AI failure (3 attempts).
- **test_cases/**: 5 input/output pairs.
- **solution.cpp**: The $O(N \log (\max A))$ reference solution.
- **problem.md**: Full problem statement.

## Testing
1. Compile the solution: `g++ solution.cpp -o sol`
2. Run against test cases: `./sol < test_cases/1.in`
